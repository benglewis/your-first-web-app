# Exercise 2: Getting started with React

## How to start:
- Run `npm start` inside the `hello-world` folder to run the React development server. This will launch your application in your browser automatically.
- Open the `hello-world` folder in order to find all the code relevant to this exercise.
- Note: Since this is a special development server, it will automatically refresh the webpage after your changes, and so you don't need to refresh on your own after code changes.

## Requirements:
- Your application should present a menu that shows links to Google and Apple's websites.
- Your application should present a paragraph with the text `Name:`.
- Immediately following this paragraph, the application should present a text input box.
- Your application should present an h1 header that says `Hello NAME` where `NAME` is the value of the text in the input and should update when the user inputs different values into that text box.

## Steps:
1. Create a new `Menu.jsx` file that will host several links. Use your knowledge of React props.
   Hint: You can use HTML `span` elements instead of `div`s since they are inline for a horizontal menu or you can use absolute CSS positioning to create a vertical menu.
2. Go to the `App.jsx` file and follow the hints.

## Optional steps:
- Run `npm run build` command to build your React application so that you can share it with others. This will produce a copy of your React application ready to serve online in the `./build/` directory.

## Context:
- We've setup a `create-react-app` application for you in the hello-world folder using the command `npx create-react-app hello-world` (Note: `npx` is Node package manager's (NPM's) direct to execution command which downloads, installs and executes an executable library - in this case - `create-react-app`).
- We've then removed the default rotating logo header and updated the App component to present a new Menu component that receives an array of menu entries as a _prop_ named `items`.
- We have renamed all the file extensions to .jsx instead of .js - this isn't the default for `create-react-app` but has better compatibility with JSX syntax highlighting in some editors and works perfectly automatically.
- For more details of the setup - read the README inside the `hello-world` directory that is provided with `create-react-app`.
