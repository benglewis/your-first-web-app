# How to complete Exercise 1

1. Fix the HTML [index.html] so that now tags (e.g. head/h1) don't show and so that the images are shown.
2. Fix the CSS [index.css] so that the paragraph text is blue.
3. Fix the console.log call [index.js] - you will probably see in your browser *console* that we are trying to modify a variable unsuccessfully. You should fix this.
4. Fix the setTimeout call [index.js].
