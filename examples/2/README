# How to complete Exercise 2

## Context
- We've setup a `create-react-app` application for you in the hello-world folder using the command `npx create-react-app hello-world` (Note: `npx` is Node package manager's (NPM's) direct to execution command which downloads, installs and executes an executable library - in this case - `create-react-app`).
- We've then removed the default rotating logo header and updated the App component to present a new Menu component that receives an array of menu entries as a _prop_ named `items`.
- We have renamed all the file extensions to .jsx instead of .js - this isn't the default for `create-react-app` but has better compatibility with JSX syntax highlighting in some editors and works perfectly automatically.

## Execution
- Run `npm start` inside the hello-world directory to run the React development server. This will launch your application in your browser automatically.
- For more details of the setup - read the README inside the `hello-world` directory that is provided with `create-react-app`.

## Steps:
1. Create a new Menu.jsx file that will host several links. You can use HTML `span` elements instead of `div`s since they are inline for a horizontal menu or you can use absolute CSS positioning to create a vertical menu. Use your knowledge of React props.
2. Replace the CHANGE_NAME_FUNCTION handler with your own React _state hook_ which will update the `name` variable. The default name should be `"No-name"`.
3. (Optional) Run `npm run build` command to build your React application so that you can share it with others. This will produce a copy of your React application ready to share in the ./build/ directory.
